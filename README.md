# HOW TO USE
Once you click an ormanent in the Christmas tree, a song will play and you can click the snowflake to either pause or play.

When the snowflake is blue, the music is on. The snowflake is gray when no music is currently played.

# SOURCE
## Music
All music is from https://www.free-stock-music.com/

## Code
All HTML and CSS are mine.

For JS:
- For the play function of the ornaments, I couldn't find a way to shorten and combine them together so I put 5 songs/5 ornaments in 5 functions. I also tried some tutorials online about arrays/conditions but nothing worked out.
- For the play/pause button, I tried various to make it work (eg conditions, tutorials from class, online sources) but again, they didn't work (maybe because my play functions are separated?). At the end, I saw someone online suggested assigning x and y value for when the songs are played/paused. I think this project could be done better so please let me know if you have any recommendation to improve my work.

Thank you so much.
